# tlc-login-form
Plugin for modifying the Wordpress login form

Feel free to use this plugin, but note that you will almost certainly want to update the actual message that is prepended to the login form.
This is extremely simple.  Simply edit the content of the tlc_login_message function in tlc-login-form.php.
